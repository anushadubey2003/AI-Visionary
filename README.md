AI Visionary – Age & Gender Intelligence System

AI Visionary is a production-oriented computer vision system that predicts age range and gender from facial images in real time.
Built with scalability, accuracy, and real-world deployment in mind — not just academic theory.

This project demonstrates how deep learning models can be transformed into API-driven AI services used across industries like security, marketing, healthcare, and analytics.
